# minecraft-crafting
This is a collection of images and GIFs of all Minecraft crafting recipes, as of 1.19. These were all pulled from [minecraft-crafting.net](https://www.minecraft-crafting.net/), using [Save All Resources for Chrome](https://github.com/up209d/ResourcesSaverExt).
## Usage
The *\source* folder has everything organised, ripped straight from [minecraft-crafting.net](https://www.minecraft-crafting.net/).
The *\dump* folder has all the crafting recipe images only, dumped into one folder.
Their files are .gifs for things like **craft_axes** where it is a recipe for all axes, or .pngs for things like **craft_observer** for one recipe.
